# Student Management System

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a console-based application developed in C++ designed to manage and organize student records efficiently. The system allows for the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of essential student data, aiding academic and administrative processes.

## Features

- **Student Registration**: Records unique registration numbers for each student.
- **Personal Information Management**: Stores and manages students' names.
- **Academic Performance Tracking**: Captures and manages marks for two core courses: CSE1001 and CSE1002.
- **Proctor Assignment**: Records the proctor ID assigned to each student.

## Data Structure

The system stores the following data for each student:
1. **Registration Number**: A unique identifier for each student.
2. **Name**: The full name of the student.
3. **Marks in CSE1001**: The score obtained by the student in the course CSE1001.
4. **Marks in CSE1002**: The score obtained by the student in the course CSE1002.
5. **Proctor ID**: The ID of the proctor assigned to the student.

## Usage

1. **Add Student Record**: Input the student's registration number, name, marks in CSE1001 and CSE1002, and the proctor ID.
2. **View Student Record**: Retrieve and display the stored data for any student using their registration number.
3. **Update Student Record**: Modify the existing records for any student.
4. **Delete Student Record**: Remove a student's record from the system.
